Node.js has a single-threaded event loop architecture.
When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop and registers several system-level event handlers, such as for incoming network connections, file I/O, and timer events.
When an I/O operation is initiated, such as a file read or a network request, Node.js registers a callback function with the event loop instead of blocking the thread until the operation completes.
The event loop then continues to run, checking for any pending I/O operations that have completed and invoking the appropriate callback function to handle the result.
The event loop has several phases, each representing a different type of task.
In each phase, the event loop polls for events of that type and executes any callbacks registered for those events.
Once all callbacks in the current phase have been executed, the event loop advances to the next phase and repeats the process.
This allows Node.js to handle I/O operations efficiently without blocking the event loop.
Overall, the event loop is the core of Node.js architecture, allowing it to handle large numbers of simultaneous connections and perform I/O operations efficiently without blocking the thread.
